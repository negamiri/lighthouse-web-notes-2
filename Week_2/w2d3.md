# Week 2 Day 3 notes

# Morning lecture: CRUD with Express

BREAD (more representative than CRUD):
Browse
Read
Edit
Add
Delete

Route - verb + path
(example: GET /urls)

Map out BREAD before you start creating your code so you can check everything off.

POST/PUT/PATCH (similar)
Out of the box Express only has Post

const { name, image } = req.body;
Same as =>  const name = req.body.name;
            const image = req.body.image

.find is the same as going through a loop and it matches the first instance
