# Week 2, Day 2 notes

## Web servers

- Software that allows us to make connections
- Client request - Server response

### Servers:
1. Name - indicates what we have
2. Address - indicates where it is
3. Route - indicates how we get there
4. Port - allows us to run multiple servers on a single host

response.send()
response.redirect()
response.render() =>provide name of ejs file in brackets

### Middleware
= General ways to handle requests (for example for calling all images in a public directory) --> available on express

``` javascript
app.use(function(request, response, next) {
  var middleware = express.static ('public')
  middleware(request, response, next)
  })

//or

app.use(express.static('public'))

  ```


## ES6
- Add

``` javascript
"use strict";
```

to top of js files to use strict form of javascript (for example, needing to declare variables with 'var' 'const' or 'let')

Can add "use strict" at file level (top of file) or function level (top of function)

Back ticks can be used for multi-line strings

When using "this" in object, function will be called when invoked rather than when written
Do not use arrow functions with "this" in objects


## Reading notes:
All web applications allow users to manipulate data in 4 ways (CRUD / HTTP):
1. Create   GET
2. Read     POST
3. Update   PUT
4. Delete   DELETE
