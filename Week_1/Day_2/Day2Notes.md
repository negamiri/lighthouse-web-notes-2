# Day 2 notes

## Morning lecture - KV

### Approaching coding problem
- Convert it to pseudo-code (language you understand)
- Break down the problem
  - Take very small modular steps
  - Run each step
  1. Have an expectation
  2. Cause an error
  3. Fix the error (small step)
  4. Confirm the fix

"Incremental development"
"Error driven development"

Lectures are about:
* Approach (debugging and incremental dev)
* Demo
* Inspire
* Entertain

### Solving the problem
- console.log(sum(numbers)) --> expressions can contain expressions - recursive
- SRP = smallest response possible? single responsible principle?

- Working incrementally and using error-driven mindset
  1- Is usually faster than the DIRECT path to the solution
  2- Debugging becomes easier
  3- Errors become more familiar and are controlled
  4- Learn other things than just the L0 of the problem
  5- If 1 is not true, other points still stand


### Keyboard shortcuts
Command-K - clear output history
Command-P / Command-T - opening another file in Sublime
"Clear" - clear screen that's visible
 - changing all variables' names
 "node" - Open node wihin command line

## Compass notes
All of the following are inherently "falsey":
* False
* 0
* "" (empty string)
* null
* undefined
* NaN

## Afternoon lecture - Don

When reading through code, skip over function until it's called
.split always returns an array

### Secret to coding
Everything we do in coding, is:
* Data - Do I have acces to the data I need in the format I expect?
* Syntax - Did I use the correct keywords and symbols to communicate with the compute the way I want it to?
* Logic - Did I communicate a clear set of steps to solve the problem?
