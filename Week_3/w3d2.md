# Week 3 Day 2 notes

## Client-side Javascript

- Read up on: Tree model (computer science)
  - Nesting in HTML

Open devtools -> Console -> enter "window" or "navigator"
- Read about "localStorage"

.preventDefault => telling browser don't do what you normally do, I've got this (need another thing done)

## J Query

Library vs framework
- Framework = collection of libraries with an opinion on how to use it

$ => global variable that points to JQuery function

.method().chaining() => we can chain JQuery functions


``` javascript
$(function() {
  console.log('DOMContentLoaded')
})

*shorthand for content loaded
```

Adding things in < > in jquery creates new element
