## Size elements in CSS

Pixels: Absolute unit of measurement
em: relative to the size of its parent-element
rem (root em): relative to the size of the html element

Font-size idea:
* px at the root
* rem for components
* em for text elements

size: vw (viewport width)
Can also do calculations. For example:
font-size: calc(10px + 1vw) (will have min 10px size)
